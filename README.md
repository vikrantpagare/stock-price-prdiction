# Stock Price Prediction using Supervised Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using supervised learning techniques. The data is sourced from Yahoo Finance, and a new column called Tomorrow is added to the dataset, representing the closing price of the next day. This data is then used to train the model.

## Features
Data Loading: Fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance. 

Data Preparation: Adds a new column Tomorrow to the dataset, which contains the closing price of the next day. 

Model Training: Uses the prepared dataset to train a supervised learning model for stock price prediction. 


## Load the data from Yahoo Finance:
        import pandas as pd
        import yfinance as yf
